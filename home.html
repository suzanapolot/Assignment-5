        <p class="P5">
            Making sense of all the different varieties of chicken feed can be very confusing for first <br>
            time and even semi-experienced chicken keepers. “Mash”, “grower feed”, “medicated or unmedicated”, <br>
            there is so much jargon on the chicken menu it can genuinely be quite overwhelming. <br> 
            At Sues Poultry we sell all kinds of chicken feeds and also offer advise on what is appropriate <br>
            for you.We also offer advice to our customers on how to make success of their poultry business.
